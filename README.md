# WFAlerts_Telegram_Bot
A Telegram bot to keep you up to date on Warframe Alerts!

This scripts consumes tweets from @WFAlertsMods using Twitter's REST api then outputs it via Telegram's API. The
bot has many different commands to help parse and consume the information. This bot is intended to keep players of
Warframe updated about the current alerts and was also quite fun to make. Game can be found at [https://www.warframe.com/].

You can directly follow @WFAlertsMods at [https://twitter.com/WFAlertsMods]. I am not affiliated with the game, Digital Extremes
or @WFAlertsMods.
